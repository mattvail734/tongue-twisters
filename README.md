Other Natural Language Processing Tools

| # | Tool | Description |
|---|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)| Built on top of NLTK, TextBlob is very easy to learn, but is also relatively slow. |
| 2 | [CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/)| Developed by Stanford in Java it can be integrated with NLTK and is much faster. |
| 3 | [Gensim](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim)| Very good memory usage optimization. |
| 4 | [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/)| Written in Cython and very fast. |
| 5 | [PolyGlot](https://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)| Also very fast. |
| 6 | [Pattern](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/pages/pattern-en)| Most other NL tools use pattern for their part of speech tagging, but you can implement it directly. |
