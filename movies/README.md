# Movie Reviews

Brief exploration of the MovieLens database and supervised semantic analysis of the built in NLTK movie reviews. 

movie_reviews is a simple first use of the NLTK library in Python to classify moview reviews as positive or negative [(sentiment analysis)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis).

movie-data is just for practicing with Pandas and visualizing some of the ratings data. The verbal reviews are separate from the numerical data (i.e. different users, totally unrelated)

This code follows along with the UCSD Data Science notebook found [here.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/polymathnexus5/synthetic-smarts/blob/master/notebooks/Natural%20Language%20Processing%20of%20Movie%20Reviews%20using%20nltk%20.ipynb)

Other movie data is just used for visualization and exploration at this time.

reference.py is just some extra code written for testing and debugging while building the review script.
